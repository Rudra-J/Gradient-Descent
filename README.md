## Introduction

### What do we mean by gradient descent?
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning. It finds the best parameters for a model by iteratively adjusting them in the direction of steepest descent (opposite to the gradient) to minimize a cost function, achieving convergence to a local minimum.. 

### Techniques
- Machine Learning

### Usage
The function can be used in various projects. The nomenclature is that x is the input that accepts an n-dimensional array and contains the independent variables. y is an input that accepts a one-dimensional array and contains the dependent variable. itter is to give the number of iterations you the code to run
